This is a React project created with CodeSandbox.

## Learning from this Project

- **Use of `flex-grow` and `flex` properties**: These properties help distribute remaining space within a container. When applied to an item, they allow that item to grow and take up available space in the layout.
  
- **Use of `overflow`, `overflow-x`, and `overflow-y`**: These properties control the overflow behavior of content. They are useful for handling content that exceeds the container's bounds, either vertically or horizontally.

- **Use of `word-wrap: break-word`**: This property ensures that long words will break and wrap onto the next line instead of overflowing outside the container.
